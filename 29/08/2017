Today we strugled to dig up few software requirement for the display of rasberian os in a windows terminal because we donot have a vga to hdmi converter

Lex terminal is a software which might help.

oh finally with the help of VNC  and putty we are able to connect to raspberry pi. dhcp server is a software which helped to remotely configure the ip of raspberry

Problem: But the problem still exist because the internet in the raspberry pi cannot be accessed.the reason is that the only lan slot is not vacant.
